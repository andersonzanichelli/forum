#Forum Server#

You will need a MySQL database and need execute these scripts below:
```sql
create database forum character set utf8;
create user 'forum'@'localhost' identified by 'forum';
grant all privileges on forum.* to 'forum'@'localhost';
```

You will need a container web to deploy the war generated by the Gradle command:
In the project folder, type in the terminal
```shell
./gradlew build
./gradlew war
```

And copy the war generated in the build folder to your web container (like a Tomcat)
cp build/libs/forum-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war (container path)/forum.war
